Hi! I'm Janelle and I'm a newly converted Business and Computer Science student, design enthusiast, and a not-so-secret lover of techie things or a.k.a that mildly artsy person.

When I'm not trying to figure out why my Comp Sci projects don't work, I love traveling, taking photos on my phone while traveling, and the occasional Japanese anime series.
