Hi! I'm Janelle and I'm a former ISV Technical Evangelist at Microsoft Canada, a past Business and Computer Science student, design enthusiast, and a gamer with a weakness for good design.

When I'm not trying to figure out why my projects don't work, I love traveling, taking photos on my phone while traveling, and playing competitive FPS games!
