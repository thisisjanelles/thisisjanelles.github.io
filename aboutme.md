Hi! I'm Janelle and I'm a newly converted Business and Computer Science student, design enthusiast, and a not-so-secret lover of techie things or a.k.a that mildly artsy person.

When I'm not trying to figure out why my Comp Sci projects don't work, I love traveling, taking photos on my phone while traveling, and the occasional Japanese anime series.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.)
