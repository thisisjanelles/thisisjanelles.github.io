title: Women Who Code TO Meetup - Create Your Own Social Media Analyzer Using Azure AI and Serverless Computing
tags: [community]

Yesterday, I got the chance to crash the awesome Shopify Toronto office and attend my first ever [Women Who Code TO](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Toronto/) event - a workshop on [how to create your own social media analyzer using Azure AI and serverless computing](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Toronto/events/250630693/)!

The workshop was being led by [Margaryta Ostapchuk](https://twitter.com/in4margaret), a Technical Evangelist on Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering team. She put together the lab material, which is also available [here](https://github.com/in4margaret/wwcazure) so anyone can do the same workshop we did! It's a great intro lab to some pretty cool Azure services that I'd recommend to anyone wanting a taste of Azure.

Initially, myself and two other friends from work had planned to go to this event as attendees but, at the last minute, we were asked to help with facilitating and proctoring the workshop. As someone who has never really proctored a workshop for Microsoft before, this was honestly a slightly terrifying idea to me at the time! But the three of us agreed and spent the night before going through the material ourselves to prepare.

Finally, workshop day! This also being my first time visiting the Shopify office, I had to take some photos on the way to the event space!

I was dumb and didn't eat before coming to the meetup, but luckily, some pretty good food was provided for everyone to munch on and nobody had to build a social media analyzer on an empty stomach!

Margaryta kicked off the workshop with a short presentation on [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) and, after a quick walkthrough of the lab, the real hands-on work began!

As everyone got to work, I was definitely still nervous about being the person that everyone would be asking questions to, but thankfully, the lab that Margaryta put together wasn't too complex, which was perfect for the attendees as many of them weren't very familiar with Azure and perfect for me as a first-time proctor. However, even though it was simple, I thought the lab was great at showcasing Azure's capabilities well and allowed a lot of room for exploration beyond this introductory workshop.

For example, one of the attendees I worked closely with didn't have a Twitter account - which the lab required - and for various reasons, was unable to create a new account at the workshop. So we decided to deviate slightly from the lab's instructions and to try and use Facebook instead. This was an especially significant moment for me where I was able to help and guide someone in learning about Azure and was definitely a high point of my first time proctoring. It took a little longer and we actually went slightly over the ending time of the workshop, but with the help I was able to provide and the attendee's curious questions, we were able to implement the lab in a different way using Facebook!

Before long, the evening was over and it was time to go - but not before grabbing some awesome water bottles and Azure stickers from the organizer as souvenirs!

It was short, but I had a lot of fun proctoring, met a lot of awesome people, and even learned some new things about Azure myself in the process. Proctoring a workshop was definitely a different experience than just being an attendee and I have a feeling I'll be getting more involved in similar events and workshops in the future!
