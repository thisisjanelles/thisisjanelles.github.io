Two years ago, I remade my blog and said I would finally stick to it. It was a fresh start, I said. I will *not* let this be another abandoned project, I said. Needless to say, for various reasons, that was a complete failure and my blog became another unmaintained effort once again.

But now, with some prompting from my awesome work mentor and a fresh, new 2018, I've decided to give this another shot. A lot of things have changed in the past few months - I graduated, moved to a new city, started my first full-time role, travelled to a lot of new places, picked up new hobbies, and am facing lots of new challenges - so if there was ever a good time to try and finally get my personal website and blog together, it's now.

My work mentor initially suggested for me to keep a blog for the purpose of writing about what I learn as I work on personal projects but I decided I want to try combining that with what I initally wanted to blog about before - travel, art, and just other personal life things I want to write about. I may still change it up depending on how it goes but for now, expect a crazy mix of code, travel photos, and maybe even some art!

I'm currently working on fixing up the "Portfolio" section of my site and then I may start working on a post about how I set up this site in the first place as that has been a learning experience in itself. Hopefully, this will be the year I finally stick with this and see it through!
