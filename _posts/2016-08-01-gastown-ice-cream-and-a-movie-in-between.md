After living under a rock for way too long, I finally had a free day last weekend!

What initially started out as a “business” trip with my friend to scout out locations for an event we are currently putting together became a spontaneous adventure exploring Vancouver and just doing whatever we felt like at the moment and while I also enjoy planning things out, it was really refreshing to just go with the flow for once. Starting from the Vancouver Convention Centre, we first wanted to try out [Fly Over Canada] (https://www.flyovercanada.com/) since neither of us had ever been on it yet. However, due to the large amount of tourists at this time of year, we were told that the wait would be over 45 minutes long and that we would have to stand in line the entire time. We weren’t willing to spend that much time waiting for just a 20 minute show so we decided to walk down to Gastown instead for something like an impromptu photo walk for our recently lacking Instagram feeds. While in Gastown, we unintentionally ended up walking far enough to end up close to [Soft Peaks] (http://softpeaks.ca), a fairly new ice cream place that we, again, had never been to yet. Naturally, we got ourselves some Honeycomb Peaks - yum!

We then somehow had the great idea of going to see a new movie, Star Trek Beyond, and headed to the Scotiabank Theatre - where the show time we wanted ended up not having any good seats left. Not to be discouraged, we bought tickets for a later showing and went to the Vancouver Art Gallery to kill some time. Following the pattern of the day, unfortunately, we didn’t know the gallery’s hours and arrived there five minutes before closing. So with not enough time to explore the gallery but a lot of time to spare before the movie, we ended up browsing the sales going on in Nordstrom and Pacific Centre instead and had a quick dinner at the food court before going back to the theatre for the movie.

I rarely go out so this was a really fun day where even the mishaps just became some funny stories to tell and I think I just realized how much I prefer going out in small groups. I spent the whole day with just my one friend and it was great being able to change plans at a moment’s notice without having to worry about a huge group. On top of that, being in small groups means you can get some actual conversation in and we had lots of good bonding talks throughout the day. Again, I rarely go out, but I don’t think I would mind having another day like this at all.
