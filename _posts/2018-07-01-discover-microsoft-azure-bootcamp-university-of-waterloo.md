title: Discover Microsoft Azure Bootcamp at the University of Waterloo

Last June 27, 2018, I was given an awesome opportunity to speak on the second day of the Discover Microsoft Azure Bootcamp organized by students at the University of Waterloo. The bootcamp ran for several days and and culminated in a case competition where teams of both technical and non-technical students formed a realistic business solution for problems and inefficiencies in the education industry by leveraging [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/).

Working together with my coworker and friend, [Heather Grandy](https://twitter.com/hgrands), we prepared a short presentation and demo of [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) with the help of [material](https://github.com/in4margaret/wwcazure) from [Margaryta Ostapchuk](https://twitter.com/in4margaret), a Technical Evangelist on Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering team who led the Women Who Code Toronto workshop on Cognitive Services.

After my initial experience proctoring the Women Who Code workshop, this opportunity to speak was a great next step for me to develop my presentation skills and get involved in building the Microsoft community. I'm honestly glad it was a student run event since, having graduated not too long ago, I felt a little less pressured and intimidated by the audience!

On the day of our presentation, Heather and I stopped by a small coffee shop in Waterloo called [Settlement Co.](https://settlementco.ca/) where I had some Frozen Hot Chocolate and a giant chocolate chip cookie for a snack! It was actually a pretty nice cafe with lots of seating, power outlets, and Wi-Fi - perfect for students or mobile workers like myself and Heather.

We arrived early at the Waterloo Science Teaching Complex where the event was being held so we would have time to get settled and find our way. Thankfully, we didn't get too lost!

The organizers set up the room nicely before people were meant to arrive.

Soon, the room was filled - Heather and I were presenting to a full house!

We kicked off the evening with a very entertaining presentation on The Evolution of Cloud by [David Martin](https://twitter.com/The_D_Martin), a Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure Group Lead. It was a tough act to follow but soon, it was our turn!

I was really nervous, but fortunately, everything went well! Our demo worked, we finished within our time limit, and our audience was engaged and learning from us.

We closed the evening with a very informative Introduction to Machine Learning presentation by [Ahmed Adel](https://twitter.com/Ahmed_Adel), an Azure Senior Product Marketing Manager. It was a great end to a great evening and I was really proud of what we were able to do for the students at this event!

I'm sure I still have a lot to improve on, but overall, I'm really glad I had this experience and am satisfied with how it turned out. It was a lot of fun, the event was organized really well, and I hope I'll have another opportunity to engage in the community again soon!
